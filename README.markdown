Hacking Vimoutliner
========================================

Intro / Motivation
------------------------------

Vimoutliner's a great tool.  Exceedingly simple, but immensely powerful.
I use it to manage a 30.000+ line todo/journal/braindump file that grows
at a steady pace of about 10-50 lines a day.  Yeah, you're a bigshot
writer, so what?  Well, Vimoutliner slows down.  Noticeably so.  That's
because there's a lot of recursion in VO's functions and I tend to sick
'em on outlines that are very deep and very involved.  In addition, I'm
running the corresponding Vim instance on a machine that's not exactly
state-of-the-art in heating the room.
